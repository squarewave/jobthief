# jobthief
WIP Work-Stealing Job System in C. Contained in a single header file to make including in your project simple.

```c
// Do this once, where you want the implementation to be defined:
#define JOBTHIEF_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "jobthief.h"

...
```

```c
// Then you can just do this:
#include "jobthief.h"

...
```
